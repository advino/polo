# Polo
An autonomous explorer during the age of COVID 19

Polo is an agent designed to record and document its surroundings as it travels across a landscape deeply affected
by COVID  19. In a time where we as citizens are physically separated from one another, Polo traverses from space to space
documenting through GPS and Image data, the various conditions and lifestyle changes we are undergoing in face of the
rapid spread of COVID 19.

## The Mission

Polo will embark on a indefinite mission to document the lives of those who have requested to be visited. Polo will be
deployed via USPS and will use an onboard camera and LTE comms shield to document and transmit its location and surroundings.
It will continue to do so until the list of desitinations have been exhausted, or if it exhausts its ability to transmit data.
